why_not_downloads = "Why I can't extract to the Downloads folder?"  
not_downloads_explanation_part1 = "Because if you allow access to the Downloads folder to any website it might try to read your downloads and leak your data and sadly the current specification of the thing that handles it does not have any mechanism to avoid that other than blocking entirely access to that folder. Create a new folder and use it instead. By the way Firefox and many other browsers does not implement that thing because, as you may guess, despite it being quite useful for developers, it opens a security can of worms. Also Chromium blocks the \"~\" character from file names even if "
